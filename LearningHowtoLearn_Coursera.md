# Learning How to Learn Cheatsheet



# Week 1
There are two modes of thinking in human brain.
### Focused mode
is when we intently focus on something. The focused mode is centered in the prefrontal cortex and often seems to involve thinking about things you are somewhat familiar with. Like solving a multip­lic­ation problem or trying to find a word that rhymes with another.

### Diffuse mode
is a more relaxed thinking style related to a set of neural resting states. The diffuse mode of thinking is called while working on concepts you haven't thought of before.
It allows for more broad ways of thinking. With traveling along new pathways, new neural connections are built. You can't focus as tightly as you often need to. 

you're either in the focused mode or the diffuse mode of thinking. <br>
It seems you can't be in both thinking modes at the same time.

#### Incidentally, both metaphor and analogy are really helpful when you're trying to learn something new.

Comparison:<br>
the diffuse mode could be thought of as a flashlight set so that it casts its light very broadly, but not very strongly in any one area. (As opposed to the focused mode, which would have its light cast very strongly in a single area, but very weakly everywhere else


#### Procrastination
When we look at something that we rather not do, the areas of our brain associated with pain are activated. Naturally, our brains look for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching our attention to something else. <br>
After this switching, the unpleasant sensation goes away and we feel happier temporarily.
That is how and why we procrastinate.

But Researchers found a trick to deal with procrastination.<br>
Neurodiscomfort disappeared after a while you jumped into the task.
万事开头难。只要开始行动，就没有难事。

##### Pomodoro: Pomodoro technique--25 minutes of steady concentration with no disruptions
Everyone has issues with procrastination, even elites in academics or industry.
Turn off all the notifications and set Pomodoro, it's a very effective technique to concentrate.

Among all the different careers and disciplines that people can pursue, why do those involving math and science make people feel more challenged? Because of the abstract nature of the ideas.
#### Memory

#### Sleep
